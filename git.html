      <h1>GIT</h1>
      <p>
        Git is free and open source software for distributed version control:
        tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work
        among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software
        development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for
        distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches
        running on different systems).[9][10][11] Git was originally authored by
        Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other
        kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[12] Since
        2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other
        distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server
        systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged
        repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities,
        independent of network access or a central server.[13] Git is free and
        open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.
