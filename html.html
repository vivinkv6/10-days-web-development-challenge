        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
        assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
        scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML
        documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
        documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a
        web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of
        the document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With
        HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
        be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such
        as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the
        page. Other tags such as surround and provide information about document
        text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display
        the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
